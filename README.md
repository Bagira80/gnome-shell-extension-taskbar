Everybody,

I am very sad to announce the end of the TaskBar extension for GNOME Shell. 

I have been enjoying developing this extension for nearly 6 years now, starting with GNOME 3.6.2. Over time a few hundred lines of code became a few thousand.

But now GNOME has changed in a way that I am unable to keep up, it requires a lot of time, espescially for research, with only little documentation from GNOME to go along. Time is the big issue here, I simply do not have it.

Now this extension is plagued with memory leaks and other inconsistencies that seem unfixable, and believe me, I have tried a lot of stuff in the past few weeks to no avail. I would basically have to rewrite this extension from scratch.

Thanks for all the great ideas, bug reports, translations etc. We had a good run!
